# Black Darkness Docker

This docker image is used for deploying minecraft servers, specifically the Black Darkness server (modded forge server).

Most credits goes to the original author: [Original repo](https://github.com/itzg/dockerfiles).

This repo is to make sure that I still have the dockerfile if the original creator chooses to deleate his repo, or if I want to make any changes, which i definitely want.
